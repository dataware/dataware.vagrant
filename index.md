title: Becoming Dataware
---

## A quick overview

Dataware is a set of technologies developed via two Horizon hub funded projects, Personal Containers and Becoming Dataware. Part of Horizonâ€™s mission to address the challenges posed by the lifelong contextual digital footprint, Dataware enables individuals to regain control over use of the digital data constantly being created about and by us. The essential enabling design feature is that Dataware provides a set of mechanisms that enable you to control access by others to your data held in multiple locations according to how it is generated.
